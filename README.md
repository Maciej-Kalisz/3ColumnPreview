## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS v3.1.8 (via CDN)
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This project definitely showed me how far my responsive design skills need to be improved. 
Building from this, I'm going to start working with a mobile-first workflow which, as evidenced by this project, will save me a massive amount of time.
